   "summary": "A Python script that packs a container with a specified shape using randomized placement, then calculates the resulting space efficiency.",
   "date": "2016",
   "problem": "You have a container. Given a series of items of the same size and shape, what space efficiency can be achieved by randomly selecting an x,y coordinate at which to place each item inside the container? • Is efficiency greater or smaller when items are smaller? • What shapes fare better than others? • Does the size of the container matter?",
   "solution": "Test your hypotheses, and see how efficient your selections can be.",

   "title": "Hackscrapers SF",
   "summary": "A Python/Flask full-stack web app built over the course of 4 weeks during the intensive Hackbright software engineering fellowship.",
   "date": "2016",
   "problem": "Hackscrapers SF encourages users to get to know the skyline of their city and explore the tall buildings around them. An API call to Flickr returns building photo urls, based on a query of photo tags, but the accuracy of existing Flickr tags, given the intent of the search, is not 100%. The quality of these tags is improved as users of the Hackscrapers app crowdsource their accuracy.",
   "solution": "The app authenticates with a Flickr account and makes API calls so that users can save their favorite photos of buildings and contribute their own photos to the photos database.",
   "description": "Users interact with a Mapbox GL web map that displays markers to represent tall buildings from a PostgreSQL database. An AJAX request returns a chart with more information and a Flickr photo selected at random from metadata stored in a MongoDB database. The photo results can be further queried to allow users to contribute their own search terms and filter per their interests. Users can then assemble collectible cards to display favorite buildings on their profile.",
   "future": "Future features: Establish a training dataset to tag a good or bad photo, using machine learning to know which photos are of an actual building and of decent quality.",

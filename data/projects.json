   "date": "2009",
   "description": "By probing the travel behavior and modal shifts of Vélib users, I investigated the interplay between both real and perceived effects of bike-sharing as a new transportation option in Paris. Informed by the cognitive mapping literature, the study methodology involved the gathering of route sketches from Vélib’ users’ and analyzing the resulting maps in relation to modal shifts to Vélib’, trip purpose, and trip distance estimation. In addition, I used GIS to test for spatial patterns according to levels of station use. The findings in this paper include the following: among a significant portion of Vélib’ users, the Vélib’ system serves as a substitute commuter mode from bus and metro use; longer Vélib’ trips tend to be underestimated; and a walkability measure of 200 meters to the nearest bike station appears to influence stations’ level of use. Ultimately, although the data are insufficient to be conclusive, my thesis proposes that initial system scale and density of bike stations contribute to the overall success of a bikesharing program, as measured by both ridership and modal shifts.",

Once fulfilled desire dissipates. The architectural manifestation of desire is the continual rotation of cubes: the opening and closing of new and different pop-up spaces. No experience of the library is the same as another. Each visit to the library produces a new engagement with it. In order to model the architecture to perform this function, I created a Grasshopper script to model the constraints of the rotating cubes. Through pop-up spaces, each visit is a new experience.",

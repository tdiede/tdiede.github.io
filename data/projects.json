Users can interact with a Mapbox GL web map that displays markers to represent tall buildings from a PostgreSQL database. An AJAX request returns a chart with more information and a Flickr photo selected at random from metadata stored in a MongoDB database. The photo results can be further queried to allow users to contribute their own search terms and filter per their interests. Users can then assemble collectible cards to display favorite buildings on their profile.",

According to San Francisco's Chief Economist, in order to stabilize median rents in the city, an estimated 100,000 units of housing would need to be constructed; this amount equals the number of units built since 1920. Where lot size allows, the solution may be modular. Here we look to architecture for a minimum viable living condition. What sort of secondary structure can property owners consider to add capacity to their lots? This app guides users through various design and material options and their aesthetic implications.",

   "title": "<h2>Modal Shift to Vélib’ Bike Share: A Cognitive Mapping Approach</h2>",
   "date": "<h4>2009</h4>",
   "description": "By probing the travel behavior and modal shifts of Vélib users, I investigated the interplay between both real and perceived effects of bike-sharing as a new transportation option in Paris. Informed by the cognitive mapping literature, the study methodology involved the gathering of route sketches from Vélib’ users’ and analyzing the resulting maps in relation to modal shifts to Vélib’, trip purpose, and trip distance estimation. In addition, I used GIS to test for spatial patterns according to levels of station use. The findings in this paper include the following: among a significant portion of Vélib’ users, the Vélib’ system serves as a substitute commuter mode from bus and metro use; longer Vélib’ trips tend to be underestimated; and a walkability measure of 200 meters to the nearest bike station appears to influence stations’ level of use. Ultimately, although the data are insufficient to be conclusive, my thesis proposes that initial system scale and density of bike stations contribute to the overall success of a bikesharing program, as measured by both ridership and modal shifts.",

   "date": "<h4>2011</h4>",
   "description": "The program of this design studio taught by Cristina Goberna was a library, which we explored through a novel of our choosing: <i>The Name of the Rose</i> by Umberto Eco. From the role the library playes in the novel, I extrapolated the theme of desire: that through never reaching an endpoint, as in a labyrinth, one continues to experience desire. Once fulfilled desire dissipates. The architectural manifestation of desire is the continual rotation of cubes: the opening and closing of new and different pop-up spaces. No experience of the library is the same as another. Each visit to the library produces a new engagement with it. In order to model the architecture to perform this function, I created a Grasshopper script to model the constraints of the rotating cubes.",

Now a landmark, the pavilion's design combined inspiration from traditional Finnish wood-working techniques and innovation made possible by computer-aided manufacturing methods. The structure stands via a basic mortise and tenon joint, where each beam either receives of abuts to four other beams creating a highly stable weave pattern. A factory-scale CNC machine cut 490 distinct Kerto-Q wood beams, ranging in length from 2-6 feet. The use of CNC fabrication resulted in extremely high tolerance, allowing the entire structure to work in compression with no glue, and minimal screws.",

   "summary": "A master's thesis using GIS analysis and mapping to study bike sharing in Paris.",
   "date": "2009",
   "description": "By probing the travel behavior and modal shifts of VÃ©lib users, I investigated the interplay between both real and perceived effects of bike-sharing as a new transportation option in Paris. Informed by the cognitive mapping literature, the study methodology involved the gathering of route sketches from VÃ©libâ usersâ and analyzing the resulting maps in relation to modal shifts to VÃ©libâ, trip purpose, and trip distance estimation. In addition, I used GIS to test for spatial patterns according to levels of station use. The findings in this paper include the following: among a significant portion of VÃ©libâ users, the VÃ©libâ system serves as a substitute commuter mode from bus and metro use; longer VÃ©libâ trips tend to be underestimated; and a walkability measure of 200 meters to the nearest bike station appears to influence stationsâ level of use. Ultimately, although the data are insufficient to be conclusive, my thesis proposes that initial system scale and density of bike stations contribute to the overall success of a bikesharing program, as measured by both ridership and modal shifts.",

   "description": "The program of this design studio taught by Cristina Goberna was a library, which we explored through a novel of our choosing: <i>The Name of the Rose</i> by Umberto Eco. From the role the library playes in the novel, I extrapolated the theme of desire: that through never reaching an endpoint, as in a labyrinth, one continues to experience desire. Once fulfilled desire dissipates. The architectural manifestation of desire is the continual rotation of cubes: the opening and closing of new and different pop-up spaces. No experience of the library is the same as another. Each visit to the library produces a new engagement with it. In order to model the architecture to perform this function, I created a Grasshopper script to model the constraints of the rotating cubes. Through pop-up spaces, each visit is a new experience.",

The structure stands via a basic mortise and tenon joint, where each beam either receives of abuts to four other beams creating a highly stable weave pattern. A factory-scale CNC machine cut 490 distinct Kerto-Q wood beams, ranging in length from 2-6 feet. The use of CNC fabrication resulted in extremely high tolerance, allowing the entire structure to work in compression with no glue, and minimal screws.",
